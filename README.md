# Predicting-Churn-for-Bank-Customers-
# Introduction
Customer churn can be a major threat to businesses that need to sustain development and competitiveness. Financial services. Often in financial services, the customer relationships are long-term and high-value, so it is key to understand the reasons why customers leave. This project would use the customer data to draw useful patterns and trends that drive the churn behavior with a view to assisting in making wiser churn strategies in SmartBank, a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group.

# Problem Statement
SmartBank has lost customer retention, which is especially evident among younger professionals and small business bank clients. Such a tendency may indicate that there are cracks in customer satisfaction or fitment with the service. To eliminate the problem, it is important to study the customer data and find out the main factors that lead to churn. The result will inform the creation of a predictive model to lead to timely and focused interventions.

# Data collection
The dataset considered in this analysis was retrieved on Kaggle, a trusted enterprise of open-source datasets and data science competitions. It is a simulation of customer data of a financial institution, and it is used largely for churn prediction assignments.

A single record represents the customer, and the variables are both demographic and behavioral ones; the values are captured. Finally, there is a binary labeled churn (Exited) to signify whether the customer left the service or not.

Major categories of features: Demographic Information Has Gender, Age, and Geography that make it easier to put the customer background in perspective and give a basis to categorize customer behavior.

Details of Account and Services They include Tenure as well as NumOfProducts with HasCrCard and IsActiveMember, which establishes that the presence of a customer is related to the service timeline.

Financial Data Incorporates CreditScore, Balance, and EstimatedSalary that indicate the financial status of the customer and his/her potential.

Target Variable

Exited: A binary variable with one being the churned and zero remaining retained.

The data set presents a reliable basis for determining reasons that lead to customer churn and can be used in coming up with predictive models to help enhance retention strategies.

# Stakeholders
The individuals and groups of people affected either directly or indirectly by the effects of this customer churn analysis are as follows:

Executive Team-SmartBank This group will take care of strategy formulation decisions and will employ insights on churn to come up with customer retention policies and resource deployment in terms of intervention strategies.

Data Science & Analytics Unit As a senior data scientist, Li leads this team to monitor the modeling process and will use the ready data set and the results to create and implement the predictive churn model.

Teams: Marketing, Customer Retention Such teams will be dependent on the output of the model to create and execute specific campaigns focused on the vulnerable categories of customers.
# Data Analysis
# Univariate Analysis
# What is the distribution of customer ages?

The age distribution of the customers is skewed to the right, and the majority fall between the ages of 25 and 40. The lowest age identified is 18 years, and the highest is 92 years, portraying a wide range of customer demographics. The average number is nearly 39 years, and the histogram reveals a cluster at 30- 35 years of age. This imbalanced allocation means that the bank mainly attracts the young or middle-aged clients, compared to old clients.
